This demo began with the [Unity Procedural Boss Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVSmp0zW8pY) [(Source available here)](https://on.unity.com/37K5j1b), which our team converted into a multiplayer experience with two different game modes.

The purpose of this technical demo is to show how to take an existing, single player project and convert it to handle a full, multiplayer game cycle. The demo is designed to work with Colyseus version 0.14.5 and [Unity version 2020.1.5f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases).

Please check our [documentation](https://docs.colyseus.io/demo/starboss/) for more information about utilizing this demo
